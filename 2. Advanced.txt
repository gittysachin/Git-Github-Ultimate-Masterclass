//////////// Branching and Merging

Branch = Timeline of Commits
Branch Names are Labels
Deleting branch label only

Git Branching - we can create a new branch and rejoin the branch by Merging
in any changes that occured on the new Branch

Types of Merging   ----

1. Fast-forward Merging -> simplest case, like never branched, can be disabled
///// git will merge all commits from all the other branches directly on to the parent branch as if we never branched off to begin with

2. Automatic Merging -> non-conflicting merge detected, preserves both timeline, merge commit on destination
///// doing so the old branch's timeline is preserved and a new merge commit is created to show the merging of the two branches

3. Manual Merging -> Automatic merge not possible, conflicting merge state, changes saved in merge commit
///// which means all merge conflicts must be resolved prior to move forward with the commit
///// once all conflicts are resolved then those changes are saved as a merge commit


//////////// Special Markers

like "pointers", HEAD, points to last commit of current branch, can be moved (Advanced)


/////////////////////////////////////////////Branching

git branch   /// shows current branch
git checkout -b updates   //// creates a new branch "updates" (-b) and switches the branch to updates
git hist         // history of the branch master is associated to updates
git diff updates master   // shows what's the difference in between the two branches

//// if there is no difference then add some other files and commit and then check difference
git add -u
<<<<<<< HEAD
git commit -am "Updated files and modified"
=======
>>>>>>> very-bad
git checkout master    //// switch branch from updates to master
git merge updates      //// merges changes in updates to master
git branch -d updates    ///// deletes the branch updates

git branch
git hist

git checkout -b very-bad
git branch -a    /// shows all branches including current branch
git commit -am "causing issues again"

git checkout master
/// change any of the file and add and commit it
<<<<<<< HEAD
git merge very-bad   ss
