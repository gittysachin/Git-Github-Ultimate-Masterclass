///// In previous section we used SSH Authentication with Github
///// In this section we'll setup another authentication method SSH ---- It saves time once its setup is done

// By the way SSH stands for Secure Shell
// and GPG stands for Gnu Privacy Guard
/// 1. Generate SSH key on your local system

ls .ssh     /// checks if .ssh if is present or not
mkdir .ssh        //// create directory .ssh

cd .ssh
ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "your@email.com"   /// generate a ssh key, -t for type, type is gonna be rsa, -C for combinate

ls -al   /// to list all files in the directory you saved your ssh keys
// open the file with exension .pub and copy text, then paste it in your github ssh settings

ssh -T git@github.com    /// to connect your PC to github SSH
